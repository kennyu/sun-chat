### Data Flow

1. **Message Sending**:
   - User types message → Optimistic UI update → Store in SQLite
   - Message sent to Convex via mutation → Stored in Convex DB
   - Real-time sync broadcasts to all participants via WebSocket
   - Participants receive message instantly with typing indicators

2. **Offline Handling**:
   - Messages saved to local SQLite when offline
   - Queue tracked locally with pending status
   - On reconnection, queued messages sync automatically
   - Full chat history always available from local storage

3. **AI Features**:
   - User requests AI action (e.g., "summarize thread")
   - Request sent to Convex function with authentication
   - RAG pipeline retrieves relevant conversation context
   - AI agent processes request with LLM and function calling
   - Response streamed back to user in real-time

## Database Schema

### Core Tables

- **users**: User profiles with Clerk subject ID, display name, avatar
- **rooms**: Chat rooms (direct or group)
- **memberships**: Many-to-many relationship between users and rooms
- **messages**: Chat messages with room, sender, content, timestamps
- **receipts**: Read receipts tracking message delivery status
- **presence**: Real-time presence and typing indicators

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v18 or higher)
- **npm** or **yarn**
- **Expo CLI**: `npm install -g expo-cli`
- **Convex Account**: Sign up at [convex.dev](https://convex.dev)
- **Clerk Account**: Sign up at [clerk.com](https://clerk.com)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sun-chat.git
cd sun-chat
```

2. **Install dependencies**:
```bash
npm install
```

3. **Set up Convex**:
```bash
npx convex dev
```
This will:
- Create a new Convex project (or link to existing)
- Generate your `CONVEX_URL`

- Enable Email/Password or OAuth providers
- Copy your publishable key and JWT issuer URL

5. **Configure environment variables**:

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:
```env
CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT=dev:your-deployment-name
EXPO_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL=https://your-deployment.convex.cloud
EXPO_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_xxxxx
CLERK_JWT_ISSUER=https://your-clerk-domain.clerk.accounts.dev
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxxx
```

```bash
npx convex dev
```
The schema will be automatically pushed from `convex/schema.ts`

## Testing Scenarios

The app has been tested for:

1. ✅ Real-time messaging between two physical devices
2. ✅ Offline message queuing and sync on reconnect

8. ✅ Typing indicators and presence updates

## Troubleshooting

### Convex Connection Issues
- Ensure `convex dev` is running
- Check your `EXPO_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL` is correct
- Verify network connectivity

### Authentication Issues
- Verify Clerk publishable key is correct
- Check JWT issuer URL matches your Clerk domain
- Ensure Clerk app is properly configured

### App Not Loading
- Clear Expo cache: `npx expo start -c`
- Reinstall dependencies: `rm -rf node_modules && npm install`
- Check that all environment variables are set

## Performance

- Message delivery: **< 200ms** on good network
